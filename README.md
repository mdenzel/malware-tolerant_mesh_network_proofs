# ProVerif Proofs for Mesh Network

Paper:    Malware-tolerant (Mesh-)Networks
Authors:  Michael Denzel, Mark D. Ryan

## Quick Start

*REMARK: ALL PROOFS REQUIRE PROVERIF v. 1.97!*

Simply run the shellscript in the command-line:

```
	$ sh ./run_all.sh
```

(tested on Fedora 26; ProVerif v. 1.97)

Keywords:

```
d/d1/d2      = Device d, d1, d2
A            = IRS Group A
B            = IRS Group B
success      = proof reaches the end of the protocol
YES          = ProVerif file proves the property
NO           = ProVerif file does not prove the property
```

There is also a self-explanatory CONFIG section in `run_all.sh`.


## Running ProVerif Manually

Since there are 36 proofs, we generate the proofs from the `*.gen`
files using the C-pre-processor. The `run_all.sh` script has an
option (ONLY_GENERATE) to generate the proofs without running them.

Afterwards the ProVerif files are in the sub-folder
`./proofs/proofs-*`. They can be run separately and are named by
the compromised devices.

To run a proof, execute for example the following:

```
    $ proverif ./proofs/proofs-1_get_ticket.gen/2_d_compromised.pv
```

*REMARK:*
success is a (dummy) secret which gets leaked at the end
of the protocol to indicate that it ran through. Thus,
when running manually, ProVerif should return `false`:

```
The attacker has the message ~M_15024 = success.
A trace has been found.
RESULT not attacker(success[]) is false.
```


## Explanations

The proofs are an abstraction of the original protocol. A few explanations:

1. We do not specify which encryption method to use. Thus, encryption
   is simply a secure channel between devices. In ProVerif we modelled
   this by making the channels private (or public if compromised).

2. Even though some encryption is irrelevant for the ProVerif
   proofs and thus not modelled (in particular the ones between
   Bridges and d in the get_ticket protocol), they are necessary to
   make it impossible for the attacker to tell apart votes and
   signup messages. If only `votes to exclude` were encrypted --
   which is enough to make ProVerif accept -- the attacker could
   simply block all encrypted messages and would effectively forbid
   voting. ProVerif cannot model this. The additional encryption
   makes all messages unidentifiable.
